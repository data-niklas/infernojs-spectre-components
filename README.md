# Infernojs-spectre-components

UI Components for InfernoJS made with Spectre

**InfernoJS** is a really good alternative to **React**, because it is so fast and minimalistic, but there are almost no UI libraries with pre-built components.

What would happen, if one would combine **InfernoJS** and a CSS library and create components, styled with that CSS library?

ThatÂ´s exactly what I did!

I combined https://infernojs.org/ with https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre

In order to keep everything minimalistic, InfernoJS was used **without** JSX. No NodeJS modules needed, to compile the JSX code to JS.

## How to use

1.  Clone the *lib* folder into your Project
    
2.  Create a JS file (e.g.: index.js) and import it into your .html file as a module
    
3.  Now import the render method from the inferno.js file and the createComponent from the inferno-create-element file and render a InfernoJS Component on a html component
    
    Note: using c as a shorthand for the createElement method
    
    ```js
    import { render } from './lib/inferno.js';import { createElement as c } from './lib/inferno-create-element.js'import App from './App.js'render(c(App, null, null), document.getElementById('root'));
    ```
    

4.  In this case App.js would export a InfernoJS component and render it on the div with the id *div*
    
5.  In the JS file, where the InfernoJS components are declared, import createElement and all of the infernojs-spectre-components, which you need and use them in the render method of the component

## Production

-   Use the sources from the production folder, they have been minified
    
-   Read through the comments above each component, to see, which props you can pass
    

## Notes

-   Context.js file adds *Context* support, similar to Mobx for inferno [https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-mobx](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-mobx)
    
    -   create a *Context* with the **createCtx(<contextName>)** method
        
    -   subscribe to a *Context* anywhere with the
        
        ```js
        this.subscribe()
        ```
        
        method inside of a *Component*
        
    -   Set the contexts value from anywhere with the **setCtx(<contextName>,<contextValue>)**
        
    -   The subscribed *Components* state will be automatically be changed and it will contain a variable named like the *Context*
